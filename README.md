# Movies-ETL

## Overview

The purpose of the Movies-ETL Challenge was use Python and Pandas to create an extract_transform_load(ETL) function to extract data from wikipedia-movies.json, Kaggle movie_metadata.csv and MovieLens ratings.csv. We needed to transform the files by cleaning and standardizing the data so we could merge them into a movies dataframe and then load the data into a SQL datasbase called movies_sql db.
